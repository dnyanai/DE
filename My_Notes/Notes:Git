#I. To remove a file from getting commit to remote due to size issues do:
    1. First clear the cache with
            git rm --cached <FILE NAME>
            eg: git rm --cached Projects/GovData_DrugsDeaths/Accidental_Drug_Related_Deaths_2012-2023.csv

    2. Then create a .gitignore file and do the following:
        https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Recording-Changes-to-the-Repository#_ignoring
        I simply added the folder path to ignore file
        Projects/GovData_DrugsDeaths/data to .gitignore file

    3. Sometimes things from the past will haunt your git because your git tracked it, so here i get an error of large file still for a file i already moved into a new directory and created a gitignore for.
       Do this then --
            git reset -- soft origin/main
            :: This will keep local changes and clear your commits. So you dont lose your local changes but lose the commits which had fuckall tracking of dead stuff.
            :: If you seek to rewrite your local branch with everything remote, then do this --
            git reset -- hard origin/main

    4. Now do git push, if you have made too many changes to the folder structure which is not present in the remote git loc then you need to do a force push --
            git push origin main --force
